## About
I am a versatile data professional with the skills to work as a Data Scientist, Machine Learning Engineer, or Data Product Manager. I hold a degree in Economics from the University of SÃ£o Paulo and had a brief experience in the financial market before deciding to pursue a career in data and technology. I've earned certifications in Data Science, Data Engineering, and Machine Learning from Data Science Academy, as well as a Data Products Management certification from Triggo.ai. I have 7 years of experience in data analysis in the energy market and an additional 6 months of experience as a Data Product Manager for an API product focused on energy data.
